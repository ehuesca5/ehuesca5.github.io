    <h3>Major-Visual Communication Design</h3>
    <p>I am currently a student at Eastern Washington and I am studying to be a Visual Cummincation Major. I also want a minore in business to help with the business side of working with companies. I decided to be a designer after taking a couple of art and design classes just to see whats it like. I was amazed how some of the things were turning out that i knew i could do something with it. this car that i have showing was my first project in Adobe Illustrator, and it was my first time using it. I dedicated my self to this and 25 hours later I had made all of this from scratch. </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p> I grew up in a small town called Mabton, Wa, both my parents worked in the fields so I had first hand experience on how hard of a world it is. That drives me to succeed. I grew up with 2 brothers. I worked in fruit fields in my teenage summers and I graduated with a 3.7 in highschool. I played football and did wrestling. I came to Cheney to further my education and now im studing to be a desinger.</p>
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>I got skills in computer programs that allow you to create
new images like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe indesign. I’ve taking classes design to teach all I have
to know to be successful in your company.
I’ve always had great computer skills universally so I can
do more than work programs. I have good team work
skills, I am bilingual, and I am also getting a business
minor so I can have more skills to help with the business side. I also have photography skills</p>
